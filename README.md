## Description 

Two versions of a simple game simmilar to the bouncing ball game
that is invoked on facebook messenger after touching ball icon.
The first - SFML version, was written in 2019 and it was one of my first game projects.
The second is implemented on a top of a small game engine writen with modern OpenGL and GLFW. 
Game performance is the same on both implementations. There is one difference which is not counting score in OpenGL version because i didn't managed to implement
text rendering in the engine yet. 

## Engine features

- Texture class
- Sprite class
- Renderer class
- Quick entry point
- State manager
- Resource manager
- Simplicity of use

## Compilation

You will need Visual Studio 2019. Both projects provide generate_project.bat script.
Launch it for VS2019 project generation and everything should be ready for building and running.
